# splitCheck
Am learning SwiftUI and this is an app that calculates the amount thats split when friends go to eat out. There needs to be some certain improvements 
and i would accept any help on them

The first is how to interact with the view and change the background color
Then how to clear the text field when a user interacts with it. I tried using a delegate but could not get around it.

FYI the app looks great in dark mode
